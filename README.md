# Python and scraping

This repo contains notebooks and other resources that outline how to get started with scraping in Python using Google Drive's Colab notebooks.

## Session 1: Introduction to scraping in Python

This session explores the different roles that scraping can play in a story, introduces Google Colab as a platform for writing and running Python code, and explains key coding concepts that you will need to write scrapers: variables, printing, comments, lists, looping and indices.
