# Session 1 tasks

Before session 2, you will need to do the following:

* Create a new notebook in Colab
* Create a text block and write an introduction to your notebook
* Create a variable in the first code block and store a **string** of characters in it (such as a name, or URL). Then print it.
* Create a variable and store a numerical value in it (such as a page number, or score). Then print it.
* Create a variable and store a **list** of **strings** in it (such as a list of names or URLs). Then print it.
* Create a **for loop** which goes through all the items in the list and prints each one
* [Read the Python notebook in this repo](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/pythonscraping/blob/main/pythonFirstStepsColab.ipynb) for help and examples. The notebook covers some other elements of coding in Python which you don't *have* to do, but which might also be of interest
* **Play!** Take risks. Make mistakes, then try to work out what's happening. You might (but don't have to) try some of the extra elements covered in the notebook. You might google things about Python and try some things out. It doesn't matter what you do - the main thing is to get a feel for experimentation and exploration - they are a key part of coding!
* Share your notebook with Paul and the rest of the group (you can use the Share button like any other Google doc to share a link)
